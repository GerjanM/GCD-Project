## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The project is about wearable computing. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
Here you can find the source data for the project:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

It is required to submit: 
1) R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
2) TidyDataSet.txt with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3) CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4) README.md which explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
5) Link to a Github repository with the script, codebook, tidy dataset and this README.md
